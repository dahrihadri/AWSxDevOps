# AWSxDevOps
Welcome to this AWSxDevOps project series! In this SEVEN-project series, I will create a CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy a simple web application using AWS' Code services.

## Here's what you'll build at the end of ALL seven projects:

Welcome to this DevOps project! In this guide, you'll learn how to host a static website using Amazon S3, a highly scalable storage service provided by AWS. By the end of this project, you'll have your own website hosted and publicly accessible on the web.
